# 🌐 JavaScript Events & Projects – Day 10

## ✅ Event Concepts Covered

| Concept              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Event Types          | `click`, `keydown`, `submit`, `mouseover`, etc. |
| Event Handlers       | Inline HTML, DOM property, `addEventListener()` |
| Event Propagation    | Bubbling (default) vs Capturing |
| Event Delegation     | Attach listener to parent, handle child events |
| `preventDefault()`   | Stops default browser behavior (e.g. form submit) |
| Event Loop           | JS concurrency model, call stack + task queue |
